## Description

https://www.readnwrite.org/ 

Started an Ebook Website 

https://rwebooks.com/ 

where we can get paid A-O Level Preperation ebooks.


Vulnerability checked by Talha Irfan and Huzaifa Irfan


There is free fifteen Pages for preview.
The php based script behind which returns the preview pages. return white screen, when opened in new tab or seperatedly.
The Images can be fetched by the query string of book_id and page_number. which returns white image upon normal request.

So, I developed a software that simulates request headers of the images as "Same Origin" as in the preview pages section to get all other pages of the book and download them in folder.

And Informed the developers about the bug.
